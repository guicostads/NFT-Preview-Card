### What I learned

At first glance, the challenge seemed easy to me. Then, when I started, I realized that I'd have to use CSS properties that I wasn't familiar with. The ":hover" with overlay images was pretty difficult, couldn't let it as the original. Learned about responsiveness, like using "max-width" instead of "width", and properties to let images responsive. The code isn't clean, but I tried my best as a begginer.
